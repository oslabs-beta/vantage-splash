# Troubleshooting Guide

## Error Logging
Results will be logged to the ```./vantage/log_history.log``` file in your project's root directory.  If you experience any issues at runtime, look here first to see where execution was interrupted.

## Git Integration Issues

### Git Hooks
Vantage uses git hooks to run in the background with every commit. The post-commit hook is used and can be found at `./git/hooks/post-commit` from the root directory of your Next.js app.
At the time of install, Vantage adds a post-commit script to your ```.git/hooks``` folder, however, if a post-commit script already exists it will not override it.

### Create new post-commit hook
To manually add the post-commit hook to your project, navigate to ```.git/hooks/``` and create a file named `post-commit`. 

Add the following contents to the folder:
```
#!/bin/sh
npx snapshot >&- 2>&- &
```
Finally run `chmod u+x ./git/hooks/post-commit` in your terminal to make the post-commit file executable.

### Add to existing post-commit

If you already have a post-commit git hook script in use, just add the following executable to it:
```
npx snapshot >&- 2>&- &
```
