# Understanding the Graphs

## Overall Graph

When first launced, the overall score for **Performance**, **SEO**, **Best Practices**, and **Accessibility** for the last snapshot are displayed. These are scored out of 100.

The graph shows the metric scores over time to see how they've progressed.

## Performance Metrics

When **Performance** is selected, your 6 key web vitals are displayed to the left of the graph. Selecting one web vital will show the value of that metric (in miliseconds for example) over time.

Selecting multiple web vitals will graph their score (out of 100)
