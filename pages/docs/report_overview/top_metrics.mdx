# Understanding The Metrics

## Key Lighthouse Metrics

Below is a summary of each of the key top level metric categories:
* **Performance** | Identifies areas that may lead to slow performance or reduced responsiveness, such as large images.
* **Accessibility** | Analyzes performance against accessibility best practices, including compatibility with assistive technology. 
* **Best Practices** | Recommendations against the best practices in modern web development.
* **SEO** | Highlights potential improvements to improve search engine performance.

In the vantage_report.html file, you can select two points on the graph, then hover over the list of recommendations to see further detail on each.

## Performance Web Vitals

* **First Contentful Paint ([FCP](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/))** | The time at which the first text or image is painted.
* **Time to Interactive ([TTI](https://web.dev/interactive/))** | The amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
* **Speed Index ([SI](https://web.dev/speed-index/))** | How quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.
* **Total Blocking Time ([TBT](https://web.dev/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/))** | Sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds.
* **Largest Contentful Paint ([LCP](https://web.dev/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/))** | The time at which the largest text or image is painted.
* **Cumulative Layout Shift ([CLS](https://web.dev/cls/))** | The movement of visible elements within the viewport.
