# Single vs Range View

There are two ways to view Vantage suggestions.

To switch between views, use the range switch located to the bottom right of the graph.

![Range Switch](/docs/RangeSwitch.png)

## Single commit view 

Single commit view can be selected by choosing:

<FiGitCommit size={40}/>

In single commit view, Vantage will look at a single commit's data and display all of the suggestions associated with it. These are ranked in order of importance to address.

If a value is associated with the suggestion, it is displayed, otherwise the score will be displayed.

Click on the graph to view a different commit's data.

## Range View

Range view can be selected by choosing:

<MdOutlineCompareArrows size={40} />

In range view, Vantage will compare two commit's data and display all of the applicable suggestions. These are ranked in order of variance between the two commits. 

If a value is associated with the suggestion, the difference is displayed, otherwise the score difference will be displayed.

Click on two points on the graph to view a range.
